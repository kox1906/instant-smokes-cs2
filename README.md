# Instant Smokes CS2

üöÄ A utility app for training smokes in CS2 with spawn presets, view angles, and auto-exec loader.  
Made with Python + PyQt6. Works fully offline. Doesn't connect with CS files -> No CS2 cheats, VAC safe.

---

## üéØ Features
- Choose map and spawns
- Auto-copy `setpos` + `setang` to clipboard
- Show instruction text in CS2 chat
- Load your own exec config in-game (exec.txt - you can modify with the commands you want)
- Fully configurable hotkeys via `config.json`
- Works as `.exe` ‚Äì no Python required

---

## üñ± How to Use
1. **Launch `launcher.exe`**
2. Choose a map ‚Üí select spawns
3. Click `RUN APP`
4. In CS2, press keys:
   - `I` ‚Äì copy spawn (`setpos`)
   - `O` ‚Äì aim at correct spot (`setang`)
   - `P` ‚Äì show spawn number
   - `J` ‚Äì show instruction
   - `.` ‚Äì exit the app
4.1. keys can be modified in config.json

Optional:
- Press `load exec` on main screen to load exec commands (`exec.txt`)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can edit hotkeys in `config.json`. Example:

```json
{
  "SETPOS_KEY": "I",
  "SETANG_KEY": "O",
  "SHOWPOS_KEY": "P",
  "INSTRUCTION_KEY": "J",
  "EXIT_KEY": ".",
  "EXEC_KEY": "L",
  "SHOW_COMMANDS_KEY": "K",
  "EC_SLEEP_TIME": 0.06
}

## üß† How It Works

- Launcher (PyQt6 GUI) lets you choose maps and spawn positions
- When you click `RUN APP`, the app launches a second script (`key_listener`) that:
  - Listens for hotkeys
  - Copies `setpos` / `setang` to clipboard
  - Writes them to CS2 console using simulated keypresses
- Works entirely offline. VAC-safe. No memory editing.
- Everything runs from a local `.exe` ‚Äì no Python required.

## üß™ Tested On

- Windows 10 / 11
- CS2 (April 2025 update)
- Works with fullscreen + borderless mode

## ‚ùì FAQ

### ‚ùì "Will I get VAC banned?"
No. It does not inject or modify memory. It only simulates keypresses like a macro.

### ‚ùì "Can I change hotkeys?"
Yes. Edit the `config.json` file.

### ‚ùì "The .exe doesn't launch / show console"
Try running as Administrator. Make sure antivirus didn't block it.

### ‚ùì "Nothing happens when I press keys"
Check that CS2 console is open (`~` key). And make sure you've selected spawns first.
